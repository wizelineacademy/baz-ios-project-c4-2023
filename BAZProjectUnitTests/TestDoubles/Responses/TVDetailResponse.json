For its second season CBS moved the show to Tuesday nights at 8:00 EST., opposite NBC's top ten hit The A-Team, and launched a marketing campaign featuring illustrations by Sanford Kossin of Max Klinger in a nurse's uniform, shaving off Mr. T's signature mohawk, theorizing that AfterMASH would take a large portion of The A-Team's audience. The theory, however, was proven wrong. In fact, the exact opposite occurred, as AfterMASH's ratings plummeted to near the bottom of the television rankings and the show was canceled nine episodes into its second season, while The A-Team continued until 1987, with 97 episodes.","popularity":6.819,"poster_path":"/kwE6aJel1v3xtwm4oxXylnpaogm.jpg","first_air_date":"1983-09-26","name":"AfterMASH","vote_average":5.286,"vote_count":7},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/x2WIpz9hkOS34zM9oABDMa8UoJb.jpg","genre_ids":[80],"id":121053,"origin_country":["DE"],"original_language":"de","original_name":"Schwartz & Schwartz","overview":"","popularity":2.681,"poster_path":"/s2Ljly1irkdHEUSVKoqH0JJJkfK.jpg","first_air_date":"2018-10-27","name":"Schwartz & Schwartz","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/lhd12sUUEijkOq0agxdOXv602JR.jpg","genre_ids":[18],"id":60671,"origin_country":["YU"],"original_language":"sh","original_name":"Sivi dom","overview":"A moving story about the residents of correctional facility, rejected by parents and environment.
